# Jerk
## PC Digital Assistant (Voice Operated) ##
## Overview
Provides a free, open-sourced, and local digital assistant like an Amazon "Echo" or Google's Voice Assistant. As-is, it provides a news search, creating and sending a quick email of text message, change the "wake" word,  
### Alternative considerations
This Python solution incorporates the Microsoft's "cmd" for a few ".exe" files, and Microsoft's native voice for speaking. You can try removing or altering these functions to move forward in making this a truly platform agnostic solution: 
1) def check_process
2) def close_process
3) def defrag_drive(self) 

## Closing Notes:
In case you missed the "..." dots, do the following before initial testing of jerk.py.

Open the two files ending with "_generic" and "save as" without the "_generic" suffix in the file names. Update the contents accordingly.
### Example:

Open "my_credentials_generic.py" and save as "my_credentials.py". Update the username and password, and "save".
